                <h1>Backups</h1>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>There are two important concepts to consider, when keeping your data safe: <br>
                    1.Understanding how OD Office Pro helps with backups, and critical files. <br>
                    2.Planning on what to do with those backups and critical files in the case of a disaster.</p>
                <h5>How OD Office Pro helps with backups</h5>
                <p>OD Office Pro can be configured to take regular backups of the <b>database</b>, and place these
                    backups in a place you specify. Any <b>attachments</b> you add to a patient are not part of this
                    backup, so the attachments folder has to be backed up manually.</p>
                <h5>Database</h5>
                <p>You can check the location of your database backup file by going to Management, turning to the Office
                    page, then clicking on DB Backup.</p>
                <img src="images/setup1.jpg" class="faqImg">
                <p>This will show you the configuration for generating that file. <br>
                    <span>&#8226;</span>How often <br>
                    <span>&#8226;</span>Which days <br>
                    <span>&#8226;</span>Where the file is written</p>
                <p><b>CAUTION</b> - It is a bad idea for the backup to be made on the same drive as OD Office Pro is
                    installed. If that drive were to fail, you’d lose both the original database and any backups that
                    were made.</p>
                <p>Commonly, the backups are placed onto a removable hard drive.

                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>With the drive attached, create a folder where you want the backups to go.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>In the “Database Backup Schedule” window shown above, tell OD Office Pro
                    about this directory.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Ensure that the ‘Enabled” checkbox is clicked.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Save these changes.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Test the process, by clicking “Backup Now”.</p>
                <h5>Attachments</h5>
                <p>Attachments are stored in a very specific directory on the server, and it is this entire directory
                    that needs to be backed up and stored safely away:<br> c:\SpinnakerWare\ODOfficePro
                    Server\Images.<br>If you are attaching photos/scans to patient records, you MUST backup this folder.
                </p>
                <h2>What your office needs to do</h2>
                <p>Both the database backups and the attachments folder need to be copied somewhere safe.<br>Ideally,
                    the backups should be secure, preferably offsite. That way, if anything bad should happen
                    to the server or (worse) the office in general, you’ve got files that can be used to restore your
                    office to a good state.</p>
                <h3>One Possible Solution</h3>
                <h5>Standard OD Office Pro Server Installation</h5>
                <p><span>&#8226;</span>The database is in its standard configuration, and exists on the same drive OD
                    Office Pro Server is
                    installed on, in C:\SpinnakerWare.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>The attachments are functioning, and are stored in
                    C:\SpinnakerWare\ODOfficePro Server\Images.</p>
                <h5>Target - Removable Drive</h5>
                <p>A removable drive is commonly used, which can be detached and kept safe (fireproof safe) or taken off
                    site as a means of disaster-recovery.</p>
                <h5>Backup Database</h5>
                <p><span>&#8226;</span>Using OD Office Pro Client, go the the ‘Management’ area from the Launchpad.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Go to the ‘Office’ tab, and click the ‘DB Backup’ button.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Ensure backups are ENABLED.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Ensure the LOCATION exists.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>It is safest to back up to a different drive than the database itself lives
                    on. In this case, set the location to ‘D:\ODOProBKUP\’.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Click the ‘Backup Now’ button, and go look for the file that was just
                    created. Ensure that it can be found, and has a timestamp that matches when the backup was taken.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Make sure all of these changes have been saved.</p>
                <h5>Backup Attachments</h5>
                <p>OD Office Pro Server creates a folder for, and otherwise manages, all attachments, but taking a copy
                    of this for backup purposes it outside of OD Office Pro’s area of responsibility. However, there
                    exists many free and open programs that can help with backing up this folder.</p>
                <p>Use any program that you wish, and configure it so that a copy is made and placed in the same folder
                    as the backup of the database was made, ‘D:\ODOProBKUP\’.</p>
                <h5>Single Folder containing the Critical Files</h5>
                <p>Now we have a single directory, ‘D:\ODOProBKUP\’, that contains the most critical files you’ll need
                    to rebuild your practice, from an EMR perspective.</p>
                <h5 id="setup3">Cloud</h5>
                <p>You could set up a cloud-based copy, so that any changes made to the files in the ‘D:\ODOProBKUP\’
                    drive are replicated up into the cloud.</p>

                <h1>Adding a Signature Image</h1>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p> A signature image can be capture, and then automatically added to prescription printouts.</p>
                <p>To begin, first download and print out ‘signatureSheet.pdf’, available in the Support section of the
                    website.</p>
                <p>Next, write your signature on the sheet, making sure to remain completely within the black box. It is
                    recommended that a dark pen, or even a fine-point sharpie be used, to ensure that the signature is
                    dark enough.</p>
                <p>Once the sheet has been signed, it must be scanned, using your scanner, to provide a JPEG image. You
                    may
                    have to adjust the setting on your scanner to have it output a JPEG.</p>
                <p> Signature images are part of each doctor’s profile, so to import a signature image, go to the
                    Management section of ODOfficePro, and make sure the Doctors page is showing.</p>
                <p>Select the appropriate doctor, and then press the ‘Additional Info’ button.</p>

                <img src="images/setup3.jpg" class="faqImgMd">
                <p>Now click the ‘Signature Image’ button. If this is the first time a signature has been added for this
                    doctor, then a prompt will appear, indicating that there is currently no image on file.</p>
                <img src="images/setup4.jpg" class="faqImgSm">
                <p>Click ‘Yes’ to import the signature.</p>
                <p>A File Selection prompter will appear, requesting that the scan file be selected. Make sure to select
                    the JPEG file created by your scanner.</p>
                <p>A new window will now appear, showing a portion of the scanned page, with a blue box superimposed
                    over top.</p>
                <p>Use the + and - buttons to zoom out or in, and use the mouse, holding down the left mouse button, to
                    move the scanned image around, until the signature is completely contained within the blue box.</p>

                <p>Ideally, the signature should occupy as much of the blue box as possible, with none of the
                    surrounding black box.</p>
                <p>It is not always possible to exclude the black box, but that can be dealt with at the next stage.</p>
                <p>Once the desired position and size of the signature image has been attained, click th ‘Grab’ button
                    to capture the image within the blue box. A preview of the selection will be displayed.</p>
                <img src="images/setup6.jpg" class="faqImgMd">
                <p>The left and right mouse buttons can now be used to edit the image, including erasure (right-click)
                    of unwanted marks.</p>
                <img src="images/setup7.jpg" class="faqImgMd">
                <p>When satisfied with the signature image, pressing the ‘Save’ button will save the image to the
                    doctor's profile.</p>
                <p>At any point in the future, returning to the Additional Doctor Information window for a doctor, the
                    ‘Signature Image’ button can be used to edit the signature, or to delete it, to allow a new scan to
                    be imported.</p>
                <p>When a signature image has been created for a doctor, it will automatically appear on the signature
                    line of Spectacles and Contacts prescription printouts.</p>

                <h1>Add-Ons to ODO Office Pro</h1>
                <h5>Barcode Scanners</h5>
                <p>There are no recommendations for Barcode Scanners. Any scanner you can get, will work the same
                    way...just get one you like, that has the right price. Since they all work exactly the same way,
                    there is nothing that is better or worse.</p>
                <h5>Cloud Backups</h5>
                <p>While OD Office Pro do not provide backup services, the files that are generated in the backups we
                    create can easily be saved off-site using cloud based services. We are huge fans of cloud-based file
                    backups (like Dropbox, or Sync.com) for the ease-of-use and
                    robustness.</p>
                <h5>Using Sync.com</h5>
                <p>This is the link for <a
                        href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=732847&u=1433472&m=57377&urllink=&afftrack">Sync.com</a>.
                </p>
                <p>We like it because they automatically encrypt all uploaded data, and they are located in Toronto, so
                    the data falls completely within Canadian borders, as per Ministry requirements. And their pricing
                    is good.</p>
                <p>They offer a small free service (5 Gigs), and this will be perfectly fine for offices that do not use
                    image attachments...the database will NEVER require anywhere near this amount of memory.</p>
                <p>For offices using attachments (which require more storage) <a
                        href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=732847&u=1433472&m=57377&urllink=&afftrack">Sync.com</a>
                    offers
                    a "Personal Pro" package
                    for $49 per year, which provides 500 Gigs. They have bigger options, but I cannot imagine any office
                    needing more than that.</p>
                <p>Their system works similar to Dropbox, and other cloud backup systems. Their software will create a
                    folder on the computer. Anything that is placed into that folder, will then be automatically synced
                    to their servers.</p>
                <p>With the ODOfficePro database, we set it up so that the backup file gets written into their
                    folder...which then takes the backup file, and immediately copies it out to their servers, giving
                    the office a secure offsite backup, without any intervention required by the staff.</p>
                <p>If you are interested, we will ask them to sign up for an account. Software and installation is by
                    Sync.com They provide documentation and help with this. Once they are ready, they contact us, and I
                    set up their ODOfficePro software to store the database backup file, as well as all of their
                    attachments, into that <a
                        href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=732847&u=1433472&m=57377&urllink=&afftrack">Sync.com</a>
                    folder.</p>
                <h3>Lab Interface</h3>
                <h5>DVI's RxWizard</h5>
                <p>To use <a href="https://www.dvirx.com/">DVI's RxWizard</a>, it must first be installed on one or more
                    of the office's computers. We do not provide instructions as we are not involved in that process.
                </p>
                <p>Once this is installed, it is automatically available to be used, as long as the Lab has been
                    configured.</p>
                <p>If you have already setup <a href="https://www.dvirx.com/">DVI's RxWizard</a> software, then enter
                    the webid where it says "ID". Nothing needs to be entered in the catalog section, as that will fill
                    in automatically, when the catalog is updated.</p>
                <p>As offices are creating Spectacle Orders, they can and should be reviewing these from the Orders
                    window (press the Orders button on the main window).</p>
                <p>If they have an order that is going to Zeiss (ie. one of the Zeiss labs was selected when the order
                    was created), then they simply need to right-click on that order, and select Submit to Lab. This
                    will launch RxWizard, and populate the prescription, and frame details.</p>
                <p>Please note: the lens will need to be selected manually...this is due to the lens naming convention
                    in the RxWizard program, and there does not appear to be anything we can do to get around this.</p>
                <h5>PDF Printer Drivers</h5>
                <p><a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/">CutePDF Writer</a> - A free PDF writer</p>
                <p>Once installed, you will see an additional ‘printer’ that can be used within OD Office Pro.</p>
                <h5>Texting Interface</h5>
                <p>For texting, you can choose to…
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Send reminders from the Call List
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Send a direct text message to a patient from the Tools menu of the patient
                    screen</p>
                <p>The texting configuration is simple to add, and can be found in the Management section of the
                    Launchpad. Click on the ‘Office’ tab, and then the ‘EMail/SMS’ button. To add SMS capabilities we
                    need to specify the provider and their account information.</p>
                <p>Currently, we have configured only one provider, based in Barrie. Please contact them to sign up for
                    an account that will allow for texting from within OD Office Pro.</p>

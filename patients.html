                <h1>Patient - Households</h1>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>Households are a useful concept, when you have someone on the line who wants to book multiple
                    appointments for members of their family, or generally are looking for information about others that
                    they are responsible for.</p>
                <h5>Connecting Households</h5>
                <p>It used to be that the members were linked together if they shared the same home phone number, but
                    with the advent of cell phones, this is not always a reliable method.</p>
                <p>Instead, members have to be linked without the use of the home phone number. Now, members of a
                    household can have different (or even blank) home phone numbers, but remain linked together.</p>
                <p>We added a feature by which if a patient changes (or has added) the home phone number, the system
                    will prompt the user to see if the patient should be added to the household of any patients that
                    already have that home phone number (assuming the patient is not already in their household).</p>
                <p>We made changes to support adding a new patient to the household of another new patient that has not
                    yet been saved.</p>
                <p  id="patients2">Now, when creating a new patient, the user will be able to add household members to that new patient.
                    The system will save the initial patient for them.</p>
                <p>We’ve also added right-click and Tool menu option to attach an existing Patient to the current
                    household.</p>

                <h1>Invoice Actions</h1>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>Many actions can be taken against an invoice, but only at certain points in the invoice’s life cycle.
                    This document helps understand what you can do, and when, with an invoice.</p>
                <h4>Actions</h4>
                <h5>Pay</h5>
                <p>For invoices that have an outstanding balance, payments can be made at any time.</p>
                <h5>Void</h5>
                <p>If you need to roll back an invoice, <i>and the invoice has not been posted</i>, then you can simply
                    void the invoice.</p>
                <p>Voiding an invoice means that the invoice should be disregarded, possibly because it was created in
                    error, or the customer changed their mind while still in the office. It wipes out the purchase,
                    leaving a record in the patient’s history, and it will show on the end of day.</p>
                <p>Again, once the invoice has been posted, you can no longer void it.</p>
                <h5>Reverse</h5>
                <p>Once the invoice has been posted, you have to ask yourself, “Has the invoice been paid in full?”</p>
                <p><i>If the invoice has been posted, but not paid in full</i>, you can reverse the invoice. This will
                    create reversal entries - negative amount on the original invoice - to cancel out the original
                    purchases.
                </p>
                <p>If any payments have been made on the invoice, they will also be reversed. Negative amounts will be
                    made against the same payment type as the original payment.</p>
                <h5>Refund</h5>
                <p><i>If an invoice has been posted, and has been paid in full</i>, then you need to do a refund.</p>
                <p>This leaves the original invoice intact, and creates a new invoice containing the negative purchases,
                    and negative payment.</p>
                <p>You would use this when a customer has returned or cancelled their purchase on a subsequent day, when
                    the invoice has already been paid in full.</p>
                <h5>Write-off</h5>
                <p>Until an invoice is paid in full, the outstanding balance will show up in the Accounts Receivable,
                    and there is an indicator ($) attached to the patient’s record.</p>
                <p>If you’ve tried to collect, and have decided to forego any further collection activities, you can
                    write-off an invoice. <br><span>&#8226;</span>Removes the amount from Accounts Receivable.
                    <br><span>&#8226;</span>Leaves the indicator ($)
                    on the patient’s record.</p>
                <p>The assumption is if there is any future contact with the patient, that an attempt to collect the
                    balance owing would be made.</p>
                <h5>Cancel</h5>
                <p> Cancelling an invoice is similar to writing one off. <b>The only noticeable difference, is that with
                        a cancel, the dollar sign is removed from the patient's record</b>. Just like a write-off,
                    however, the outstanding balance is removed from the Accounts Receivable. You
                    would use this when it is no longer appropriate to collect the balance owing. For example, if a
                    patient comes in and pays you a deposit, but never comes in to pick up their
                    purchase or get their money back, then you would cancel the invoice. It is not appropriate to write
                    it off, as it is not bad debt since you did not lose inventory. But it is also not
                    appropriate to collect more money from this patient, as nothing was sold to them.</p>
